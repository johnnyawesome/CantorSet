# CantorSet
The famous Cantor Set written in P5JS

The Cantor Set was the first Fractal ever discovered!

## More Information

To learn more about the Cantor Set, check out [this post](https://breaksome.tech/the-grandfather-of-fractals:-the-cantor-set-in-p5js/) where I described in great detail:

- What the Cantor Set is
- How it works
- How you can code it yourself

## Other, Closely related Fractals

The Cantor Set actually is a one-dimensional version of two other very, very famous Fractals:

### The Sierpinski Carpet

If you think about it, a line has just one dimension.

And so the Cantor Set is confined to one dimension.

What happens when you draw a two-dimensional Cantor Set?

Turns out there is another famous Fractal called the [Sierpinski Carpet](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/SierpinskiCarpet), and it looks like this:

This is the same as the Cantor Set, just in two dimensions.

But wait, it gets better!

### The Menger Sponge

Check out this thing:

It's called a [Menger Sponge](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/MengerSponge)!

And - you guessed it - it's a three-dimensional Cantor Set!

You can find my version of the Menger Sponge [right here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/MengerSponge)!
